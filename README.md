# NU Knowledge Base

### Problem statement
 
An organization has multiple departments, activities, works, groups and many other things. In order to be proficient in an organization, an employee needs to have knowledge about the organization. It’s difficult to teach about everything (related to the organization) even with continuous training programs and it also hampers productivity. A knowledge base allows an employee to know about a body of organization when it's required. Organizations usually try to cover this with an online course platform subscription. But, that is very generic and not organization-specific. Knowledge has been proven a good solution to this problem. In this research project, we are measuring the impact of the video knowledge base at NIIT University (an organization).
